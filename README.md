    * **Abstract** - The evolution of effective and efficient synthetic sensor views of virtual environments to plan and execute training activities has lagged behind warfighter needs for Command and Control, Computers and Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR). We present a novel real-time system to render realistic visible and infrared (IR) surveillance and reconnaissance training scenarios. This simulation accurately generates dynamic temporal energy maps during runtime to produce imagery for various sensors and effects to create a realistic visualization experience for training. The temporal energy maps are mappings that represent the amount of thermal energy accrued over time for a given pixel on any surface form. Our system utilizes automatic material classification and a spectral material database to facilitate realistic synthetic environments under different sensor spectral band requirements. This work describes our approach to generate convincing material mapped terrain and objects. We present runtime algorithms that store temporal spectrum energy in a physically-based system to simulate temporal thermal behavior throughout the day accurately. This approach is capable of accurately rendering large high- resolution geospatial imagery. We describe our work to demonstrate the feasibility of creating real-time temporal radiative heat transfer in a commodity game engine that provides essential detail to phenomenological sensor signatures and effects. The resulting prototype delivers robust training capabilities with a detail level that allows for better training and mission planning than traditional techniques. Additionally, synthetic sensor data can be generated from this approach and can be used to train machine learning algorithms that require large datasets where imagery is difficult to acquire.


### Realtime Procedural Landscapes

Realtime Procedural Landscape development utilizes the Realtime Mesh Component Plugin to build procedural meshes in realtime in Unreal Engine 5. This demonstration is part of an effort development for a game that pushes realtime procedural content generation. The game takes place in a graveyard and the demonstrates creating custom cut-outs to insert graves in the terrain.
